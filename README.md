# 🛠️ Debugging - Error Identification and Resolution

This directory contains a collection of Python and web-based scripts that were provided with intentional errors or incomplete functionality. Each file has been carefully reviewed, corrected, and improved to meet expected outcomes using proper debugging techniques and clean coding practices.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The purpose of this debugging project is to:

- 🔍 Identify and fix syntax, logical, and runtime errors  
- 🧯 Implement error handling using `try`/`except` to prevent crashes  
- 📄 Apply clear and professional function documentation using Python docstrings  
- 🎮 Improve logic in interactive games (e.g., Minesweeper and Tic Tac Toe)  
- 📥 Handle user input and edge cases effectively  
- 🧼 Ensure clean, readable, and maintainable code

## 📂 File Overview

| 📄 File Name              | 📝 Description  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `factorial.py`           | Fixed an infinite loop in a factorial function using a `while` loop |
| `print_arguments.py`     | Modified to print only command-line arguments, excluding the script name |
| `change_background.html` | Fixed JavaScript event binding to properly trigger background color changes |
| `mines.py`               | Added win-condition logic to the Minesweeper game                   |
| `factorial_recursive.py` | Added complete documentation using standard Python docstrings       |
| `checkbook.py`           | Added input validation and error handling for numeric operations    |
| `tic.py`                 | Corrected win/tie detection logic and added input validation in a Tic Tac Toe game |

## ⚙️ How to Run

Most Python files can be executed using:

```bash
./filename.py
```
Files such as factorial.py, checkbook.py, and tic.py require user interaction through input prompts.

To run the HTML file:

Open change_background.html in any modern web browser.

## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Input handling (`input()`, `sys.argv`)  
- Conditional logic and loops  
- Exception handling (`try/except`)  
- HTML and JavaScript DOM basics
